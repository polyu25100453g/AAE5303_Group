## Group Name
## **404_found**


## Why This Name?
"404_found" is a name that blends geek culture with an optimistic spirit. It creatively reverses the classic "404 Not Found" error state, infusing it with new meaning:

- "404" represents the inevitable unknowns, uncertainties, and temporary "loss" encountered during exploration — much like the initial challenges of visual odometry, the sparse point clouds in early-stage 3D reconstruction, or the ambiguous boundaries in semantic segmentation.
- "found" declares our core mission and goal: through algorithms, collaboration, and iteration, we strive to create order from chaos, extract meaningful signals from noise, and ultimately achieve precise localization, clear reconstruction, and accurate interpretation.

This name succinctly captures our project methodology: acknowledging problems as they exist, then actively seeking solutions through technical means. It reflects our pragmatic, humorous, and creatively resilient attitude when tackling complex spatial perception challenges.
